## Description

This repository contains code originally written for the [Climate Impact Explorer](https://climate-impact-explorer.climateanalytics.org).
It started as a rewrite of the emulator intended for provide better statistical calculations with exact frequentist estimates.
It was moved to a standalone repository for re-use in various projects, and is intended to supercede the code for the [Rapid Impact Model Emulator](https://github.com/iiasa/rime) (hence its name).
