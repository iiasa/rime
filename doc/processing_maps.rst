Example script that takes input table of emissions scenarios with global temperature timeseries, and output maps of climate impacts through time as netCDF. Ouptut netCDF can be specified for either for 1 scenario and multiple climate impacts, or multiple scenarios for 1 indicator.

This example script takes an input table of emissions scenarios along with global temperature time series and generates maps of climate impacts over time as NetCDF files. It exemplifies the application of the RIME framework to spatially resolved climate impact data, facilitating the visualization and analysis of geographic patterns in climate impacts.


process_maps.py
===============

This script is likely involved in processing geographical data, given its name suggests map-related functionalities. It may involve operations related to spatial data and possibly climate or environmental data analysis.

Key Features
------------

- **Geographical Data Processing**: Implied by the name, it might handle operations on map data, such as transforming, analyzing, or visualizing geographical information.
- **Data Handling**: The script might deal with large datasets, considering the use of ``dask``, which is known for parallel computing and efficient data processing.

Dependencies
------------

- ``dask``: For parallel computing in Python, needed for handling large datasets and efficient computation.

Usage

process_maps.py
===============

This example script takes an input table of emissions scenarios along with global temperature time series and generates maps of climate impacts over time as NetCDF files. It exemplifies the application of the RIME framework to spatially resolved climate impact data, facilitating the visualization and analysis of geographic patterns in climate impacts.

Overview
--------

The script's flexibility allows for the specification of outputs either for a single scenario across multiple climate impacts or for multiple scenarios focused on a single indicator. This adaptability makes it a valuable tool for in-depth climate impact studies that require spatial analysis and visualization.

Usage
-----

By processing emissions scenarios and associated temperature projections, ``process_maps.py`` produces NetCDF files that map climate impacts over time. These outputs are instrumental in visualizing the geographic distribution and evolution of climate impacts, aiding in the interpretation and communication of complex climate data.
