Example script that takes input table of emissions scenarios with global temperature timeseries, and output tables of climate impacts data in IAMC format. Can be done for multiple scenarios and indicators at a time. 





process_tabledata.py
====================

This script is intended for processing table data, potentially involving large datasets given the use of Dask for parallel computing. It likely includes functionalities for reading, processing, and possibly aggregating or summarizing table data.

Key Features
------------

- **Table Data Processing**: Focuses on operations related to table data, including reading, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Parallel Computing**: Utilizes Dask for efficient handling of large datasets, indicating the script is optimized for performance.

Dependencies
------------

- ``dask``: For parallel computing, particularly with ``dask.dataframe`` which is similar to pandas but with parallel computing capabilities.
- ``dask.diagnostics``: For performance diagnostics and progress bars, providing tools for profiling and resource management during computation.
- ``dask.distributed``: For distributed computing, allowing the script to scale across multiple nodes if necessary.

Usage
-----

The script is structured to be executed directly with a ``__main__`` block. It imports configurations from ``process_config.py`` and functions from ``rime_functions.py``, suggesting it integrates closely with other components of the project. Users may need to customize the script to fit their specific data formats and processing requirements.
